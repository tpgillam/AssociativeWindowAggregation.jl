For example: +, *, max, min, &&, union\n\nNB. It is interesting to observe that commutativity is not required by this algorithm, which is one of the reasons that it enjoys stable numerical performance.\n\nConceptually the window is maintained in two buffers:\n\n    [---- A ---)[----- B ------)\n        <                      >    <-- current window finishes at the end of B, and\n                                        starts somewhere in A.\n\nA is stored as a sequence of cumulative sums, such that as the \"<\" advances we merely pick out the correct element:\n\n    x_i,   x_i-1 + x_i,  x_i-2 + x_i-1 + x_i\n\nB is stored as both:\n\nThe sequence of values seen:  x_i+1,  x_i+2,  x_i+3,  ...\nThe total of that sequence:  x_i+1 + x_i+2 + x_i+3 + ...\n\nWhen the \"<\" advances from A to B, we discard A, and the subset of B remaining after < becomes the new A. In becoming A, we transform its representation into that of the cumulative sums. We create a new, empty, B.\n\nO(1) amortized runtime complexity, and O(L) space complexity, where L is the typical window length.\n\nFields\n\nop::Function: Any binary, associative, function.\nprevious_cumsum::Array{T, 1}: Corresponds to array A above.\nri_previous_cumsum::Int: A reverse index into previous_cumsum, once it contains   values.
